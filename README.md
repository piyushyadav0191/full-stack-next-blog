We will be using typescript 

lets delete unused files 
Open another terminal 

import dependcies fo sanityblog project and save it to mymodernblog

now move schemas, sanity.cli, sanity config.ts to mymodernblog main folder

now delete the folder of sanityblog

move tsconfig.json too

Now lets restart the server and do npm i 


I have updated my ts config...remember to ask me to give this file to you and replace it with yours

DONT FORGET ! SIGN AT THE END OF EACH ENV

Make sure everyhting is working or not

everyhting is goood..
and remember , all errors will be shown in terminal not in console
becuase we are using nextjs..and nextjs use server ..so server errors are shown on terminal

Lets setup studio

Lets restart the server

It can take some time..be patient

That was a mistake of my terminal..lets try again

Cool ...

My mistake.. i forgot to pause the video...lets continue



Lets add themes 

cool 

Thats all themeing...and that was very overwhelming

Lets check our studio

i forgot to save

oo shit

Now if you see your studio..it should look like this..

Our design is looking very bad...lets fix that

Cool...everyhting is back to normal...
now dont touch admin folder for now..lets use only user folder..

and the reason i did that so thta...users will have their separate section and admin i.e., (you) will have sepearate section


coool 

cool 

lets move further

You are thinking that our preview code is different right 

it is becuase..i am using sanity previous version and there was this code and i liked that

no need to worry ..it will work alright 

i forgot to save thats why that error was occured ..lets try again

you can see if i see the preview it redirects to location "/"

lets clear ...it too redirect to location "/"

cool everything is okay as per the docs of sanity ..lets move further

lets edit our section of page (user)

cool lets continue 
cool we are geetting object 
awesome 

lets rename the previewsuspense

This error occured becuase i added s in client

we are getting 4 posts that is correct..becuase in our backend we added only 4 posts

cool 

Thats it for today..let me rest and learn some questions of Unix Minor 

let us start again

lets try 
you can solve the hudration error by using the fragments 

cool right 

i dont know why description not showing ..we will fix that after some time..lets move to next

It is looking like a blog now..right ..coool very beautifull 

wow its works...
basically i created a clientsideroute wrapper which will have route that is link and that link will go to wherever the /post/slug.current page ...okay
